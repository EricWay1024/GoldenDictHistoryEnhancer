# GoldenDict History Enhancer

Add a list of new words to your GoldenDict history panel each time (so that you can remember them by reading explanations and example sentences in your dictionaries).

This Python program is developed on Arch Linux. It is required that the GoldenDict history file is at `~/.goldendict/history`, and therefore this program could directly run on a Unix machine (in theory).
