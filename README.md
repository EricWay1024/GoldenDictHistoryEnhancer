## Learning on day 1 morning

There is a list for every day. The default list is the automatically generated N words. These N words are generated at runtime. They will not include words that have appeared in past learning list, but will include those that have appeared in the history list (namely, the words you looked up for but did not formally learn). In fact, these words will be given a higher priority when the list is generated.

After first import in the morning, the history list will be only these N words. You should follow these steps:

1. You quickly go through the meanings of these words, listen to their pronunciation and try to memorize their basic meanings.

2. You read the example sentences of each words to obtain a better understanding of these words.
3. You watch the videos whose subtitles contain these words (on `youglish.com`) to further grasp the context where the words should be used whilst learning their pronunciation.

In this process, you may find that some of the words are related with other words (including the ones you've learned before), or that some words are too easy for you. You edit the list accordingly. You may:

- Delete some of them
- Change the order of them
- Add related words

After these steps, you should run the program again and it will save the current history list as today's new learning list. Then your complete history list should appear (including today's list), and you may use your GoldenDict as usual. 

## Revision on day 1 evening

Run the program in the evening and it will generate a Markdown file, where each new word in today's learning list becomes a 2-level title. You should try to make sentences using each of them (by recalling the sentences you've read and the videos you've watched). You may also briefly explain their meanings. After writing, you could open your GoldenDict to rectify possible mistakes. Save the file and this will be your learning notes.

## Revision on day 2, 4, 7, 15

Possible revision methods:

1. Open your learning notes. Firstly only focus on the outline panel in Typora (that's the word list itself) and try to recall everything related to them. Then go through your notes.
2. Replace temporarily the GoldenDict history list with the learning list of that day. However, any edition to the list here will be discarded. Then you can recover your complete history list after revision.

## Other Features

1. Check your learninng and revision status.
2. Revise any word list you manually specify.
3. Play with learned words. The program will randomly generate one learned word at a time. Try to quickly recall its meaning and move on to the next. If you have difficulty with a word, the program can provide its example sentences as a hint.
4. Search a word in your complete vocabulary list and your learned list.
